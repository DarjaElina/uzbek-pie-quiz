The idea came after a fun chat with my [developer friend](https://github.com/EvgenijHyva) 💡

While it’s not a serious project, it was a great way to practice working with full-stack features and explore Uzbek culture, which I found rich, vibrant, and inspiring. I hope this small project brings a little joy or curiosity to your day! ❤️
